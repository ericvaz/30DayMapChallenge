# 30DayMapChallenge 2024 

Welcome to the **30DayMapChallenge 2024** repository! This project is dedicated to creating a unique map every day throughout November, based on daily prompts. This year's challenge encourages creativity, exploration of mapping techniques, and storytelling through spatial data visualization. My personal challenges consists in creating all maps this year in Python. 

## Challenge Overview

Each day has a unique theme that inspires different mapping styles, data types, and storytelling techniques. Participants are encouraged to interpret prompts in their own way and showcase their creative mapping abilities!

## Tools & Techniques

Participants are welcome to use any mapping tool or software they prefer – from GIS tools like QGIS or ArcGIS to Python libraries like `geopandas` and `matplotlib`, and creative tools like Illustrator or Blender for 3D maps. The aim is to have fun, learn, and explore new ways of visualizing spatial data.

## Resources

To help you get started, here are some popular resources:

- **OpenStreetMap** for free and open geographic data.
- **Natural Earth** for high-quality raster and vector map data.
- **NASA Earthdata** for satellite imagery and climate data.
- **GeoNames** for geographic location data (cities, towns, and natural features).

## How to Participate

- Create a map each day using the provided prompt as inspiration.
- Post it to your preferred platform, using the hashtag **#30DayMapChallenge**.
- Feel free to submit PRs to share your maps in this repository, with each day’s work added to the relevant folder.

## Let’s Get Mapping!

Happy mapping, and remember to share your creations with the world. Let’s celebrate the diversity of spatial data and the power of visualization.
